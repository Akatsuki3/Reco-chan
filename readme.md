### A flask application that will scrape data or use an api(not sure yet) to provide users with recomendations based on their input 

#### Ambition behind this project 


We are a bunch of boys with an avid fiaxation with japenese culture and anime in general(basically weebs really).  
Add to this our interest in programming and technology, we were bound to choose this as our first _big_ project.
We are just starting out in serious programming concepts and we will most likely face many difficulties in shipping  
out a finished project(we alredy are) but nevertheless we'll try our best to do bring our dreams to reality.

### Progress Report   

- [x] started work on making a basic flask based web-framework
- [ ] figuring out a usable backend for the app 



Thank you for your interest ~ Nitesh and Suraj
